title: Why does my Discord always crash when opening DevTools?
tags: crashing, crashes
---

This is a stock Discord issue. There is nothing we can do

However, here are some solutions that should work:
- Many people have stated that opening devtools while Discord is still loading prevents the crashing
- Devtools work fine in [Vencord's custom client, Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop), or just your web browser - you can use the Vencord browser extension
- It seems to be an issue exclusive to Windows. You could try switching to Linux
