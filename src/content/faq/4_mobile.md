Yes actually! We have an [Android app](https://github.com/Vencord/Android) embedding the Discord website

However, as Discord's mobile website has some issues, chances are you won't like it.
In that case you will instead want to use one of the following mods focused on Mobile.

Do note however that these mods are not related to Vencord in any way, so we do not provide support or endorse
them in any way. Join their support servers for help & more info!

Vendetta (android/ios): [GitHub](https://github.com/vendetta-mod/Vendetta) - [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/n9QQ4XhhJP)
Enmity (ios only): [GitHub](https://github.com/enmity-mod/enmity) - [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rMdzhWUaGT)
Aliucord (android only, very outdated but still works well if you like the old version of Discord):
